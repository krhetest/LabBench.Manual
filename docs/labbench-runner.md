Running experiments are performed with the LabBench Runner program according to predefined protocols and experimental setups, with a simple user interface that contains only the functionality and information that is required to run a specific protocol.

Running an experimental session with LabBench Runner consists of the following steps:

* Going through the start-up wizard dialog, where you will:
  * Select the experiment you want to perform
  * Check that all the required instuments are present and correctly configured.
  * Create a new subject, or choose an existing subject.

  * Executing each test in the protocol, where:
    * Starting the test.
    * Using the Test Area to execute and monitor the test
    * When the test completes, accept or reject the recorded data

The list above provides a high level overview of how experimental sessions are performed with the LabBench Runner program, the remaining of this guide will explain in detail how each of these steps are performed.
