# Overview

LabBench Runner is used for running experimental sessions according to a predefined protocol, with a simple user interface that contains only the functionality and information that is required to run the session.

The program achives that by being designed to run only experimental sessions, and delegating the work and setup required to write protocols, setup experiments, and exporting and analysing data to other sub-programs within the LabBench system.
