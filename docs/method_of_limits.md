# Multiple Perception Thresholds

## Description

The multiple perception thresholds test is intended to find thresholds for multiple stimuli simultaneously, where the
shape one or more of the stimuli may depend on thresholds
for other stimuli being estimated by the test or on the
results of previously executed tests.

Each threshold is being estimated with the method of limits,
where the intensity of stimulus is increased until the
subject can feel the stimulus, and then decreased until
the subject can no longer feel the stimulus. Each of these
sequences of first increasing the intensity and then decreasing
the intensity is performed for each stimulus in a round-robin
fassion, between each stimulus that are ready to be tested.
Whether a stimulus is ready to be tested depends on whether it
depends on stimuli for which a threshold estimate is not yet
available.

The process of estimating the threshold is illustrated in the figure below:
